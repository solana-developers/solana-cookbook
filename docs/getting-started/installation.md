For Windows, please visit the [Rust installation site](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Install CLI

### macOS & Linux

Open your favorite Terminal application.

Replace `LATEST_RELEASE` with your desired version and install the [latest Solana release](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases) on your machine by running:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/LATEST_RELEASE/install)"
```

You can replace `LATEST_RELEASE` with the release tag matching
the software version of your desired release, or use one of the three symbolic
channel names: `stable`, `beta`, or `edge`. To find the latest release, check
versions available [here](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases).

The following output indicates a successful update:

```text
downloading LATEST_RELEASE installer
Configuration: /home/solana/.config/solana/install/config.yml
Active release directory: /home/solana/.local/share/solana/install/active_release
* Release version: LATEST_RELEASE
* Release URL: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/download/LATEST_RELEASE/solana-release-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.bz2
Update successful
```

Depending on your system, the end of the installer messaging may prompt you
to

```bash
Please update your PATH environment variable to include the solana programs:
```

If you get the above message, copy and paste the recommended command below
it to update `PATH`.

Confirm you have the desired version of `solana` installed by running:

```bash
solana --version
```

After a successful install, `solana-install update` may be used to easily
update the Solana software to a newer version at any time.

#### Downloading Binaries (Linux)

Alternatively, you can install from binaries instead of using solana-install.

Download the binaries by navigating to
[https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest),
download **solana-release-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.bz2**. Open a new terminal, move the binaries from your download folder to the root folder, then extract the
archive:

```bash
mv Downloads/solana-release-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.bz2 .
tar jxf solana-release-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.bz2
```
Next, You need to make the solana-cli accessible in all terminal.To do that, you need to add it to the PATH. Open the terminal configuration file with the command below

```bash
sudo nano /etc/profile
```
At the bottom of the nano editor shown, you will add the following line of code
```bash
export PATH=/home/coderina/solana-release/bin:$PATH
```
Save the file by pressing CTRL + X, then Y and then Enter.

Restart your Machine to make this change take effect. Voila you can now access the solana-cli in any terminal on your machine.


#### Downloading Binaries (macOS)

Alternatively, you can install from binaries instead of using solana-install.

Download the binaries by navigating to
[https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest),
download **solana-release-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.bz2**, then extract the
archive:

```bash
tar jxf solana-release-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.bz2
cd solana-release/
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```

### Windows

Open a Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`) as an Administrator.

Search for Command Prompt in the Windows search bar. When the Command
Prompt app appears, right-click and select “Open as Administrator”.
If you are prompted by a pop-up window asking “Do you want to allow this app to
make changes to your device?”, click 'Yes'.

Copy and paste the following command, then press Enter to download the Solana
installer into a temporary directory:

```bash
curl https://release.solana.com/v1.9.16/solana-install-init-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe --output C:\solana-install-tmp\solana-install-init.exe --create-dirs
```

If `v1.9.16` is not your desired version, find the latest release [here](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases).

Copy and paste the following command, then press Enter to install the latest
version of Solana. If you see a security pop-up by your system, please select
to allow the program to run.

```bash
C:\solana-install-tmp\solana-install-init.exe v1.9.16
```

To find the latest release, check
versions available [here](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases).

When the installer is finished, press Enter.

Close the command prompt window and re-open a new command prompt window as a
normal user.

Search for "Command Prompt" in the search bar, then left-click on the
Command Prompt app icon (no need to run as Administrator).

Confirm you have the desired version of `solana` installed by entering:

```bash
solana --version
```

After a successful install, `solana-install update` may be used to easily
update the Solana software to a newer version at any time.

#### Downloading Binaries

Alternatively, you can install from binaries instead of using solana-install.

Download the binaries by navigating to
[https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest),
download **solana-release-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.tar.bz2**, then extract the
archive using WinZip or similar.

Open a Command Prompt and navigate to the directory into which you extracted
the binaries and run:

```bash
cd solana-release/
set PATH=%cd%/bin;%PATH%
```

### Build From Source

If you are unable to use the prebuilt binaries or prefer to build it yourself
from source, navigate to
[https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest),
and download the **Source Code** archive. Extract the code and build the
binaries with:

```bash
./scripts/cargo-install-all.sh .
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```

You can then run the following command to obtain the same result as with
prebuilt binaries:

```bash
solana-install init
```

## Install via Docker

If you want to deploy a new project on a docker container, the easiest way to start is to clone the Solana dApp Scaffold Next Github [repo](https://github.com/solana-labs/dapp-scaffold) and after installing `docker`, you should be able to run the following:

```
docker build -t dapp-scaffold .
docker run -d -it --name dapp-scaffold-run -p 3003:3000 dapp-scaffold
```

And you should see your app run on `http://localhost:3003`.

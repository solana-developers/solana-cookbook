# Writing Programs

## How to transfer SOL in a program

Your Solana Program can transfer lamports from one account to another
without 'invoking' the System program. The fundamental rule is that
your program can transfer lamports from any account **owned** by your program
to any account at all.

The recipient account *does not have to be* an account owned by your program.

## How to get clock in a program

Getting a clock can be done in two ways

1. Passing `SYSVAR_CLOCK_PUBKEY` into an instruction
2. Accessing Clock directly inside an instruction.

It is nice to know both the methods, because some legacy programs still expect the `SYSVAR_CLOCK_PUBKEY` as an account.

### Passing Clock as an account inside an instruction

Let's create an instruction which receives an account for initializing and the sysvar pubkey

<SolanaCodeGroup>
  <SolanaCodeGroupItem title="Rust" active>

  <template v-slot:default>

@[code](@/code/programs/get-clock/method-one/program/src/lib.rs)

  </template>

  <template v-slot:preview>

@[code](@/code/programs/get-clock/method-one/program/src/lib.preview.rs)

  </template>

  </SolanaCodeGroupItem>
</SolanaCodeGroup>

Now we pass the clock's sysvar public address via the client

<SolanaCodeGroup>
  <SolanaCodeGroupItem title="TS" active>

  <template v-slot:default>

@[code](@/code/programs/get-clock/method-one/client/main.en.ts)

  </template>

  <template v-slot:preview>

@[code](@/code/programs/get-clock/method-one/client/main.preview.en.ts)

  </template>

  </SolanaCodeGroupItem>
</SolanaCodeGroup>

### Accessing Clock directly inside an instruction

Let's create the same instruction, but without expecting the `SYSVAR_CLOCK_PUBKEY` from the client side.

<SolanaCodeGroup>
  <SolanaCodeGroupItem title="Rust" active>

  <template v-slot:default>

@[code](@/code/programs/get-clock/method-two/program/src/lib.rs)

  </template>

  <template v-slot:preview>

@[code](@/code/programs/get-clock/method-two/program/src/lib.preview.rs)

  </template>

  </SolanaCodeGroupItem>
</SolanaCodeGroup>

The client side instruction, now only needs to pass the state and payer accounts.

</SolanaCodeGroup>

## How to change account size

You can change an account's size with the use of `realloc`.
`realloc` can resize an account in steps of 10KB up to 10MB of max size.
When you use `realloc` to increase the size of an account,
you must transfer lamports in order to keep that account
rent-exempt.

## How to do Cross Program Invocation

A cross program invocation, is simply put calling another 
program's instruction inside our program. One best example 
to put forth is Uniswap's `swap` functionality. The 
`UniswapV2Router` contract, calls the necessary logic to 
swap, and calls the `ERC20` contract's transfer function 
to swap from one person to another. The same way, we can 
call a program's instruction to have multitude of purposes.

Lets have a look at our first example which is the 
`SPL Token Program's transfer` instruction. The required 
accounts we would need for a transfer to happen are

1. The Source Token Account (The account which we are holding our tokens)
2. The Destination Token Account (The account which we would be transferring our tokens to)
3. The Source Token Account's Holder (Our wallet address which we would be signing for)

@[code](@/code/programs/cpi-transfer/program/src/lib.preview.rs)

  </template>

  </SolanaCodeGroupItem>
</SolanaCodeGroup>

The corresponding client instruction would be as follows. For knowing the mint and token creation instructions, please refer to the full code nearby.

  <template v-slot:preview>

@[code](@/code/programs/cpi-transfer/client/main.preview.en.ts)

  </template>

  </SolanaCodeGroupItem>
</SolanaCodeGroup>

Now let's take a look at another example, which is `System Program's create_account` instruction. There is a slight difference between the above mentioned instruction and this. There, we never had to pass the `token_program` as one of the accounts inside the `invoke` function. However, there are exceptions where you are required to pass the invoking instruction's `program_id`. In our case it would be the `System Program's` program_id. ("11111111111111111111111111111111"). So now the required accounts would be

1. The payer account who funds the rent
2. The account which is going to be created
3. System Program account

@[code](@/code/programs/cpi-transfer/program-system/src/lib.preview.rs)

  </template>

  </SolanaCodeGroupItem>
</SolanaCodeGroup>

The respective client side code will look as follows

## How to create a PDA

A Program Derived Address is simply an account owned by the program, but has no private key. Instead it's signature is obtained by a set of seeds and a bump (a nonce which makes sure it's off curve). "**Generating**" a Program Address is different from "**creating**" it. One can generate a PDA using `Pubkey::find_program_address`. Creating a PDA essentially means to initialize the address with space and set the state to it. A normal Keypair account can be created outside of our program and then fed to initialize it's state. Unfortunately, for PDAs, it has to be created on chain, due to the nature of not being able to sign on behalf of itself. Hence we use `invoke_signed` to pass the seeds of the PDA, along with the funding account's signature which results in account creation of a PDA.

## How to read accounts

Almost all instructions in Solana would require atleast 2 - 3 accounts, and they would be mentioned over the instruction handlers on what order it's expecting those set of accounts. It's fairly simple if we take advantage of the `iter()` method in Rust, instead of manually indicing the accounts. The `next_account_info` method basically slices the first index of the iterable and returning the account present inside the accounts array. Let's see a simple instruction which expects a bunch of accounts and requiring to parse each of them.

@[code](@/code/programs/read-account/program/src/lib.preview.rs)

  </template>

  </SolanaCodeGroupItem>
</SolanaCodeGroup>

## How to verify accounts

Since programs in Solana are stateless, we as a program creator have to make sure the accounts passed are validated as much as possible to avoid any malicious account entry. The basic checks one can do are

1. Check if the expected signer account has actually signed
2. Check if the expected state account's have been checked as writable
3. Check if the expected state account's owner is the called program id
4. If initializing the state for the first time, check if the account's already been initialized or not.
5. Check if any cross program ids passed (whenever needed) are as expected.

A basic instruction which initializes a hero state account, but with the above mentioned checks is defined below

## How to read multiple instructions from a transaction

Solana allows us to take a peek at all of the instructions in the current transaction. We can store them in a variable and 
iterate over them. We can do many things with this, like checking for suspicious transactions.

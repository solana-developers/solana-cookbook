# Cranking

This guide is meant to be a one-stop guidance for Zeta's Cranks

Cranking refers to the execution of multiple permissionless instructions to keep <br />
the zeta platform up to date and functioning properly. These instructions are <br />
designed to perform various tasks such as processing trade events, updating <br />
pricing information, adjusting market parameters, rebalancing funds, applying <br />
funding rates, and managing orders.

There are multiple permissionless instructions that "crank", keeping the zeta <br />
platform in an up to date state.

This guide take you to tour for crank instruction and how you can use them.

## Crank Event Queue

Process maker fill events to ensure that user margin accounts(Margin accounts <br />
hold funds for trading and collateral purposes) are in the correct state after <br />
trades occur.

* __getMarketsToCrank__ : This instruction determines which markets should be <br />
cranked based on the asset and a **flag** indicating whether only live markets <br />
should be considered. If the `asset` belongs to a ZetaGroup with only perpetual <br />
markets, it returns an array containing the perpetual market. If `liveOnly` is <br />
**true**, it retrieves the tradeable expiry indices from the ZetaGroupMarkets <br />
and fetches the corresponding markets for each index. These markets are then <br />
flattened into a single array. If `liveOnly` is **false**, it returns all <br />
markets for the given asset.

* __crankExchange__ : This instruction cranks the event queues for each market <br />
in the provided asset. It retrieves the markets to crank using <br />
**getMarketsToCrank** function. For each market, it loads the event queue and <br />
processes the events until the queue is empty. If cranking is already in <br />
progress for a market (tracked using crankingMarkets), it skips the market. <br />
After cranking, it logs the number of events processed for each market.

* __crankExchangeThrottled__ : This `function` is similar to **crankExchange**, <br />
but it introduces a throttling mechanism. It iteratively cranks each market <br />
event queue with a delay of `throttleMs milliseconds` after each market crank. <br />
This can be useful when rate limits are reached, and it helps in controlling the <br /> 
rate of API requests.

## Update Pricing

Recalculate mark prices and greeks for Zeta products on an expiry basis. This <br />
will also update perp funding rates.

This instruction enables the automatic update of pricing for options and other <br />
derivative products in a permissionless manner.

By calling Zeta's update pricing function through the `Exchange` object, it <br />
ensures that the greeks (option sensitivities) and theos (option prices) are <br />
kept up-to-date, allowing traders and market participants to make informed <br />
decisions based on the most recent pricing information.

## Rebalance Insurance Vault

The zeta platform collects fees, and this instruction moves funds between margin <br />
accounts and the insurance vault.

The insurance vault is used to ensure platform `security` and cover any <br />
potential losses. By **rebalancing** margin accounts with non-zero rebalance <br />
amounts, the function helps maintain consistent ___collateralization___ and risk <br />
management within the platform.

This instruction first Retrieved Margin Accounts and filtered then rebalanced <br />
them.

## Apply perp funding

Periodically apply any unpaid funding to all margin accounts holding perp <br />
positions.

You can use this instruction to ensure that margin accounts with `non-zero perp <br />`
positions receive the necessary funding.

It retrieves the addresses of margin accounts, fetches their details, identifies <br />
accounts with non-zero perpetual positions, groups accounts by asset, applies <br />
funding to each asset's margin accounts using the ***applyPerpFunding*** <br />
function, and `splits transactions` if there are too many accounts to process at <br />
once. This function ensures that margin accounts with non-zero perpetual <br />
positions receive the necessary funding, maintaining proper margin collateral <br />
and supporting the functionality of perpetual derivative trading within the Zeta <br />
platform.

## Prune Expired TIF Orders

When an order of TIF(Time In Force) expires it must be `pruned` to get deleted. <br />
This happens automatically if a **counterparty** tries to trade against it, <br />
however.

This function ensures that expired TIF orders are removed from the platform, <br />
maintaining the integrity and efficiency of order management within Zeta's <br />
derivative trading system.
